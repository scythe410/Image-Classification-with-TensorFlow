# Machine Learning Notebooks 📓🤖

Welcome to this repository of Jupyter Notebooks where I explore and document key concepts, techniques, and models in **Machine Learning** and **Artificial Intelligence**. Each notebook is designed to be beginner-friendly yet informative, covering both theory and implementation.

## 📁 Current Notebooks

- `01_howModelsAreTrained.ipynb`  
  A practical walkthrough explaining how machine learning models are trained. This includes a breakdown of key steps such as data splitting, model fitting, loss calculation, and optimization.

> More notebooks will be uploaded soon!

## 🧠 Topics to be Covered (Planned)

- Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning
- Model Evaluation Techniques (Accuracy, Precision, Recall, etc.)
- Overfitting vs Underfitting
- Regression and Classification Models
- Neural Networks and Deep Learning
- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Computer Vision Basics
- Data Preprocessing Techniques

## 🛠 Requirements

To run the notebooks locally, you need:

- Python 3.7+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Recommended libraries:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
